# Information collection and manipulation.  
 This section is for two programs that demonstrate some practical coding for real world situations.  These were two straight forward programs that deal with data collection and data manipulation.  
 ## _Employee Scheduler_
 
### **_Overview_**
_This was an application that utilized a seperately developed Employee class in conjunction with the Employee scheduler to capture new hire information.  Including First Name, Last Name, Employee Number and Rate of pay._  

**_What was involved ...._**
* _Employee Class_ : This is a straight forward class that contains four fields with the appropriate set and get methods. I included the output within the Employee class.  
* _Employee Scheduler_ : This is an application designed to collect batch employee information.  It was designed for the user to enter all the information on one line and the program to use the information to build a new employee object and occupy appropriate fields.  It then calls the Employee's output for the user.
  
**_Things I would change_**
* I would transfer each employee object to a temporary file and then allow user to see all entries at the end of the session 

 ## _Pay Application_
  
 ### **_Overview_**
The program was designed to accept user information regarding pay scale, hours and appropriate benefits options.  It will then calculate the appropriate total pay including total pay and appropriate deductions for choosen benefits. 
   
### **_Featured concepts_**
* Object oriented programming with heavy use of methods to handle repetative tasks.  
* Nesting and firm use of if statements.  

### **_I would change alot about this program.  I feel that it has a ton of ineffective code that could be streamlined and I would also add input verification for protection.  Due to time constraints I was not required to complete input verification for this project.  Input verification is an essential step that needs to be added to any user entered information._**
